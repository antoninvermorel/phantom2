# phantom2
This package can be considered as a more advanced package than phantom package on the CoSMo research group github. It aims to track different blobs starting from a dataset file with different interactions detection methods (only based on centers of mass distance associations for the moment) to detect mergers and splits and keeping it in memory so that it is now possible to know the origin of each tracked blob detected at a given moment, as well as its descendants.
